New York is one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the US, as well as the world. the multi-cultural city attracts many restaurants with different cuisines. In this project, we will only focus on all areas in Manhattan. We will conclude the existing Japanese cuisine restaurants compared to all other restaurants, and will use clustering to find similar areas in Manhattan regarding restaurants of each borough. The preferred area shall be distant from existing restaurants.
We will use data science tools to fetch the raw data, visualize it then generate a few most promising areas based on the above criteria. We will also explain the advantage and traits for the candidates, so that stakeholders can make the final decision base on the analysis.
